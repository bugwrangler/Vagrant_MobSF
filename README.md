# Vagrant_MobSF

I  am not managing this repo any more as docker offical image is avaialble already. 

A Vagrant box based on Ubuntu trusty64 for https://github.com/ajinabraham/Mobile-Security-Framework-MobSF

If you want to quickly try out what this is all about. Your installation will adhere to the default configuration and use the MobSF project. it's just a single command:

#vagrant up

How do I get the get the latest state/version?

The fastest way is to run vagrant provision

#vagrant --provision 

or get a shell

#vagrant ssh
